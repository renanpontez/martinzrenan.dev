## The Challenge

California Pizza Kitchen is a major restaurant chain with a high-traffic e-commerce platform serving 400k+ monthly users for online ordering and catering. The platform built with Next.js, Sass, and multiple REST API integrations was suffering from slow page loads (~4.4s) and a poor Lighthouse accessibility score of just 40, potentially violating WCAG guidelines. The catering funnel also had conversion issues with users dropping off at the location selection step.

## My Role

As the Senior Frontend Engineer at Planetary, I was responsible for:

- Optimizing UI and page architecture for performance across the platform
- Implementing accessibility best practices across 100+ pages
- Redesigning the catering e-commerce funnel with location-based features
- Mentoring junior developers with structured code reviews and component templates

## Technical Approach

### Performance Optimization

I focused on the core rendering bottlenecks in the Next.js app:

- **Component refactoring** - Reduced unnecessary re-renders and optimized critical rendering paths
- **Image optimization** - Implemented responsive images, lazy loading, and modern formats
- **Code splitting** - Strategic prefetching for likely navigation paths
- **Page architecture** - Restructured how pages loaded data and rendered content

These changes cut page load from ~4.4s to ~3.3s, a 25% improvement across the platform.

### Accessibility Overhaul

I systematically improved accessibility across 100+ pages, boosting the Lighthouse score from 40 to 90:

- **Semantic HTML** - Replaced div-heavy markup with proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, and ARIA labels
- **Color contrast** - Audited and fixed insufficient contrast ratios across the design system
- **Keyboard navigation** - Ensured all interactive elements were reachable and operable via keyboard
- **Screen reader support** - Added descriptive alt text, live regions for dynamic content, and proper form labeling

### Catering Funnel Redesign

The catering ordering flow was losing users at the location selection step. I redesigned it with:

- **Smart location-based features** - Auto-detected user location and surfaced nearest stores
- **Improved internal linking** - Better navigation between menu, catering, and checkout
- **Streamlined UX** - Reduced steps to complete a catering order

This drove a 10% increase in catering revenue (from ~5% to ~5.52%).

## Key Learnings

1. **Accessibility is systematic work** - Component-level fixes applied consistently across the design system beat page-by-page patching
2. **Small UX improvements compound** - The catering funnel changes individually seemed minor but collectively drove meaningful revenue growth
3. **Performance optimization requires profiling first** - Identifying the actual bottlenecks (rendering, not network) saved weeks of misdirected effort

## Results

- **25% reduction in page load time** - from ~4.4s to ~3.3s serving 400k+ monthly users
- **Lighthouse accessibility 40 → 90** across 100+ pages with WCAG compliance
- **10% increase in catering revenue** - from ~5% to ~5.52% through funnel redesign
