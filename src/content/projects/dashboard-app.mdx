## The Challenge

RD Station Marketing is one of Brazil's leading marketing automation SaaS platforms. The product team had an ambitious backlog of 30+ growth experiments focused on retention, engagement, and conversion—but they wanted results within weeks, not months. The challenge was prioritizing the highest-impact experiments, executing them quickly in a React and Ruby on Rails stack, and measuring results rigorously.

## My Role

As Senior Frontend Engineer, I was responsible for:

- Frontend implementation of growth experiments across the platform
- Collaborating with product and growth teams to prioritize experiments by impact
- Building and deploying A/B tests with proper measurement
- Redesigning the pricing page to optimize plan conversion and upsell
- Rebuilding the onboarding flow to boost paid user engagement

## Technical Approach

### Prioritization Framework

With 30+ experiments on the backlog, I worked with the product manager and growth team to stack-rank experiments using an impact-vs-effort framework. We identified the top three highest-impact opportunities:

1. **Pricing page redesign** — Direct impact on plan conversion and upsells
2. **Onboarding flow rebuild** — Impact on paid user engagement and retention
3. **Feature discovery experiments** — Driving users to underutilized features

### Pricing Page Experiment

The pricing page was the highest-leverage point in the conversion funnel. I redesigned it with:

- **Clear value differentiation** between plans
- **Social proof and trust signals** to reduce friction
- **Streamlined upgrade flow** to capture upsell opportunities
- **A/B tested variations** to validate each change with data

### Onboarding Flow

The existing onboarding was losing paid users before they experienced the product's value. I rebuilt it with React and Ruby:

- **Progressive disclosure** — Guided users to key features step by step
- **Personalized paths** — Different flows based on user goals
- **Engagement triggers** — Strategic nudges to drive meaningful actions

### Experiment Velocity

To ship 30+ experiments efficiently, I established:

- **Reusable experiment components** — Common patterns for A/B tests
- **Feature flags** — Quick toggling without redeployment
- **Measurement templates** — Consistent tracking across experiments
- **Weekly prioritization reviews** — Adjusting based on learnings

## Key Learnings

1. **Focus on impact, not volume** — The top 3 experiments drove more value than the other 27 combined
2. **Data beats opinions** — A/B testing resolved internal debates quickly
3. **When workload feels impossible, prioritize ruthlessly** — Saying no to low-impact work protected quality

## Results

- **7% increase in plan conversion** — from ~2.90% to ~3.19%
- **12% increase in upsell rate** — from ~2% to ~2.24%
- **66% boost in monthly engagement** — from 150 to 250 actions per paid user
- **30+ experiments deployed** with proper measurement and iteration
