## The Challenge

The business team needed a way to monitor key metrics in real-time without relying on slow, manually-generated reports. They needed interactive visualizations that could handle large datasets efficiently.

## My Role

As Senior Frontend Engineer, I:

- Designed the frontend architecture
- Implemented complex data visualizations
- Optimized rendering performance
- Integrated real-time data streams

## Technical Approach

### Data Visualization

We used D3.js for custom visualizations:

- Time series charts with zoom and pan
- Interactive heatmaps
- Customizable pie and bar charts
- Geographic data maps

### Real-Time Updates

WebSocket integration for live data:

- Efficient diff-based updates
- Reconnection handling
- Optimistic UI updates
- Fallback to polling

### Performance Optimizations

Handling millions of data points required:

- Data aggregation on the server
- Virtualized lists and tables
- Canvas rendering for dense visualizations
- Web Workers for heavy computations

## Key Features

1. **Customizable Dashboards** - Drag-and-drop widget placement
2. **Advanced Filtering** - Multi-dimensional data filtering
3. **Export Capabilities** - PDF and CSV exports
4. **Alerting** - Configurable threshold alerts
5. **Sharing** - Shareable dashboard links

## Results

- Processes **10M+ data points daily**
- **Under 100ms latency** for real-time updates
- **4.8/5 user satisfaction** score
- **80% reduction** in time to insights
