## The Challenge

Multiple teams were building similar UI components independently, leading to inconsistent user experiences and duplicated effort. We needed a unified design system that could be adopted across all products.

## My Role

I was the primary engineer responsible for:

- Building the component library from scratch
- Creating comprehensive documentation in Storybook
- Writing unit and accessibility tests
- Supporting adoption across teams

## Technical Approach

### Foundation

We built the system on top of Radix UI primitives, which provided:

- Accessible components out of the box
- Unstyled components that we could customize
- Composable patterns for complex components

### Styling Strategy

Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling because:

- Utility-first approach aligned with our design tokens
- Easy to customize and extend
- Great TypeScript support with tailwind-merge
- Small bundle size with purging

### Documentation

Every component includes:

- Interactive examples in Storybook
- API documentation with TypeScript types
- Accessibility guidelines
- Usage do's and don'ts

## Implementation Highlights

### Component Categories

1. **Primitives** - Button, Input, Select, Checkbox
2. **Layout** - Container, Grid, Stack, Divider
3. **Navigation** - Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination
4. **Feedback** - Alert, Toast, Progress, Skeleton
5. **Data Display** - Table, Card, Avatar, Badge

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with Testing Library
- Visual regression tests with Chromatic
- Accessibility audits with axe-core
- Cross-browser testing with Playwright

## Results

- **40% reduction in development time** for new features
- **Consistent UI** across 5 different products
- **Zero accessibility violations** in automated audits
- **High adoption rate** with positive developer feedback
