## The Challenge

MINE was a B2C high-ticket fashion platform that needed a standout feature to drive user acquisition and conversions. The core differentiator was an AI-powered style-discovery engine that would recommend personalized fashion items based on user preferences. The challenge was twofold: building a performant frontend that could handle the AI engine's response times, and creating a design system that could scale across the growing product.

## My Role

As Senior Frontend Engineer, I was responsible for:

- Building the frontend application with React and TypeScript
- Integrating the AI style-discovery engine with optimized UX
- Creating a scalable design system with Storybook
- Optimizing performance for SEO and organic traffic growth
- Implementing responsive images, lazy loading, and component architecture

## Technical Approach

### AI Integration & Perceived Performance

The AI API had slower-than-expected response times, which threatened the user experience. I implemented aggressive frontend optimizations to mitigate the latency:

- **Preloading strategies** — Anticipated user actions and prefetched AI results
- **Skeleton loading states** — Maintained engagement during processing
- **Caching layer** — Stored previous AI results to speed up repeat interactions
- **Lazy loading** — Deferred non-critical content to prioritize the AI experience

### Design System

I built a scalable component library using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook:

- Consistent UI components across the platform
- Interactive documentation for the development team
- Reusable patterns that accelerated feature development

### SEO & Performance

Organic traffic was critical for the business model. I focused on:

- **Technical SEO** — Proper meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML
- **Performance** — Achieved 90+ Lighthouse scores across all pages
- **Responsive images** — Automatic format selection and lazy loading
- **Component refactoring** — Reduced homepage load time by 20%

## Key Learnings

1. **Perceived performance matters as much as actual performance** — Skeleton states and preloading made the AI feel instant
2. **Design systems accelerate development** — The upfront investment in Storybook paid off quickly
3. **SEO is a growth engine** — 22% weekly organic traffic increase compounded significantly

## Results

- **10,000 user signups** in the first month
- **~10% conversion rate** — approximately 990 orders
- **22% increase in weekly organic traffic**
- **90+ Lighthouse score** across all pages
- **20% reduction in homepage load time**
