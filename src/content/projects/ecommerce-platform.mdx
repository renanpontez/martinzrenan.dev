## The Challenge

The existing e-commerce platform was built on legacy technology that resulted in slow page loads, poor mobile experience, and declining conversion rates. The business needed a modern, performant frontend that could scale with growing traffic.

## My Role

As the Lead Frontend Engineer, I was responsible for:

- Architecting the new frontend using Next.js and TypeScript
- Leading a team of 4 frontend developers
- Establishing coding standards and review processes
- Implementing the design system
- Optimizing performance for Core Web Vitals

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

We chose Next.js for its excellent SSR capabilities and built-in optimization features. The app router allowed us to leverage React Server Components for improved performance.

Key architectural decisions included:

- **Server Components by default** - Reduced client-side JavaScript significantly
- **Streaming SSR** - Improved Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- **Edge middleware** - Handled personalization and A/B testing at the edge
- **ISR** - Balanced between static performance and dynamic content

### State Management

We implemented a hybrid approach:

- **React Query** for server state (products, cart, user data)
- **Redux Toolkit** for complex UI state (filters, modals, checkout flow)
- **URL state** for shareable filters and pagination

### Performance Optimizations

- Implemented image optimization with automatic WebP conversion
- Code splitting and lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Prefetching for likely navigation paths
- Service worker for offline support and caching

## Key Learnings

1. **Incremental migration works** - We migrated page by page, which reduced risk
2. **Measure everything** - Real user metrics were essential for prioritization
3. **Accessibility is not optional** - We caught significant issues through automated testing

## Results

The redesign resulted in measurable business impact:

- **95+ Lighthouse Performance score** (up from 55)
- **23% increase in conversion rate**
- **60% reduction in page load time**
- **40% reduction in bounce rate**
