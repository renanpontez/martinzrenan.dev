## The Challenge

DeOnibus was a travel tech e-commerce platform for bus tickets, operating as a multi-tenant system serving 100+ white-label domains for different bus companies across Brazil, processing millions of annual orders with real-time inventory management. The legacy JavaScript frontend had severe performance problems—page load times of around 10 seconds—and the codebase was extremely difficult to maintain with 80 separate CSS files with conflicting styles. Adding new features was becoming nearly impossible, and the slow performance was directly hurting conversion rates and driving users away.

## My Role

As the Frontend Engineer leading this migration, I was responsible for:

- Architecting the gradual migration strategy from legacy JS to React
- Implementing Server-Side Rendering for improved performance and SEO
- Designing the new component-based CSS architecture
- Building caching strategies with Redis for high-traffic volume
- Maintaining feature parity across 100+ active white-label domains
- Ensuring zero-downtime deployments throughout the migration

## Technical Approach

### Gradual Migration Strategy

A "big bang" migration was not an option—we couldn't afford downtime with millions of annual orders. I architected a page-by-page migration strategy using React with Webpack, SSR, lazy loading, and Context API.

Key architectural decisions included:

- **Server-Side Rendering** - Improved initial page load performance and SEO across all white-label domains
- **Strategic lazy loading** - Prioritized critical rendering paths to get content visible faster
- **Redis caching** - Handled high traffic volume efficiently with smart caching layers
- **Context API** - Managed state across the multi-tenant architecture

### CSS Consolidation

The legacy system had 80 separate CSS files with conflicting styles. I consolidated them into structured SCSS files following a component-based architecture, reducing the count by 69% to just 25 files. I also introduced Styled Components for new components and Lottie animations to improve the UI.

### Payment Recovery System

During the migration, we identified that approximately 5% of orders were being lost to failed payment attempts—about 500 lost orders translating to significant revenue loss. I collaborated with the backend team to build a Node.js REST API and TypeScript bot for automatic payment retries, recovering those lost orders.

### Fraud Prevention

I optimized the payment validation flow and Adyen integration, which decreased fraud attempts by 14%—approximately 2,800 fewer fraud attempts per year.

## Key Learnings

1. **Gradual migration reduces risk** - Migrating page by page while maintaining feature parity kept the business running
2. **Performance drives revenue** - The direct correlation between page speed and conversion rate was dramatic
3. **Technical debt compounds** - Investing in the foundation paid off exponentially as new features became faster to build

## Results

The migration delivered measurable business impact across all 100+ white-label clients:

- **60% reduction in page load time** — from 10 seconds to 4 seconds
- **30% increase in conversion rate** — from ~2% to ~2.6%, translating to significant revenue growth
- **~500 lost orders recovered** via the automatic payment retry system
- **14% decrease in fraud attempts** — ~2,800 fewer per year through optimized payment validation
- **69% reduction in CSS files** — from 80 to 25, dramatically improving maintainability
