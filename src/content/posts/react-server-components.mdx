React Server Components (RSC) represent a fundamental shift in how we build React applications. Let's explore what they are, how they work, and when you should use them.

## What Are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that render exclusively on the server. Unlike traditional React components that run in the browser, Server Components never ship JavaScript to the client.

This has several important implications:

- **Zero bundle size impact** - Server Components don't add to your JavaScript bundle
- **Direct backend access** - You can query databases directly without an API layer
- **Better security** - Sensitive data and logic never reaches the client

## Server vs Client Components

In Next.js 13+ with the App Router, all components are Server Components by default. To create a Client Component, you add the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file:

```tsx
"use client"

import { useState } from "react"

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## When to Use Each

**Use Server Components when:**

- Fetching data from a database or API
- Rendering static content
- Using server-only dependencies
- Keeping sensitive logic on the server

**Use Client Components when:**

- Using React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Adding event listeners (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- Using browser-only APIs
- Needing interactivity

## The Composition Pattern

A common pattern is to keep data fetching in Server Components and pass data down to Client Components for interactivity:

```tsx
// Server Component
async function ProductPage({ id }) {
  const product = await fetchProduct(id)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      <AddToCartButton product={product} /> {/* Client Component */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Performance Benefits

Server Components can significantly improve performance:

1. **Smaller bundles** - Less JavaScript to download and parse
2. **Faster data fetching** - Server is closer to the database
3. **Streaming** - Content can be sent progressively
4. **Caching** - Server-rendered content is easily cacheable

## Conclusion

React Server Components are a powerful tool for building performant React applications. By understanding when to use Server vs Client Components, you can optimize your application for both performance and user experience.
